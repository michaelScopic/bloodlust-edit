# Bloodlust Edit

Self-made edit of Bloodlust, Hate and Gasoline, and Sharpness's 300k pack, along with a glint. Just a mashup of all three of those packs.

Just a pre-warning, I have zero clue how to make texture packs, I just copied and pasted textures from one pack to another and somehow it works. ðŸ’€
